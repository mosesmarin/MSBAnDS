Instructor bio: Welcome to class, I am happy you are joining me for the summer!  Just a little about me - I am a Professor of Professional Practice in Business Analytics.  I am the former director of Community Epidemiology and Evaluation at the Oklahoma State Department of Health where I led a team of analysts who focused on community-based public health initiatives. We worked with county health departments across the state on staffing, patient flow, project planning, and analytics.  I currently do research on commercial sexual exploitation/ human traffickingLinks to an external site., communication between parents and adolescents about sex, and infant and early childhood mental health collaborations. 

On the personal side, my husband and I have 2 kids, 2 dogs, 1 cat, 2 rabbits, 2 horses, and 9 goats.  It is always loud, crazy, and chaotic at my house and we love it!
